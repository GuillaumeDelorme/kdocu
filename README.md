**K**otlin utilities for **Docu**mentum DFC

### About the project

**KDocu** aims to make Documentum DFC more Kotlin friendly.

A small example :
```Kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    getSession("myrepo", "myuser", "mypassword").use { session ->
        execReadQuery(session, "select object_name from dm_server_config").use { collection ->
            while (collection.next()) {
                println(collection.getString("object_name"))
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Sessions

Get a Documentum session and use it like an AutoCloseable class :
```Kotlin
getSession("myrepo", "myuser", "mypassword").use { session ->
    // Using the session...
}
// The session is closed automatically
```

### Queries and collections

Execute a DQL query and use the collection like an AutoCloseable class :
```Kotlin
execReadQuery(session, "select object_name from dm_server_config").use { collection ->
    while (collection.next()) {
        println(collection.getString("object_name"))
    }
}
// The collection is closed automatically
```

Available functions for executing queries are :
- `execQuery(session, query)` : Execute a DQL query
- `execReadQuery(session, query)` : Execute a read-only select DQL query. The query must not make any change during processing
- `execCachedQuery(session, query)` : Execute a read-only cached DQL query
- `execApplyQuery(session, query)` : Execute a DQL Query that invoke procedure. For example GET_PATH

### Building the project

To build the Gradle project, you need the DFC dependency that isn't available in Maven public repositories.
You can download Documentum REST Services SDK on the EMC support website. This package contains scripts to deploy Documentum libraries in your local Maven repository.
